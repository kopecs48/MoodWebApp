# MoodWebApp
MoodWebApp allows for users to create new accounts, login, and create mood posts. Each mood post displays the title, body, and streak field after being created by posting to the /mood endpoint. The streak field increaments the previous post's streak value if the most recent post is from yesterday. If there was no post yesterday it will default to 1.
